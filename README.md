# BetterNavigation
This app that allows better outdoor wayfinding for the blind and visually impaired. 

It is still pretty rough, but the core is in a working condition.

If you want to try it, you need to get a Google Maps API key and create the file /app/src/debug/res/values/google_maps_api.xml like so:
```xml
<resources>
    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">YOUR_KEY_HERE</string>
</resources>
```
